# Flyby-Technical Report: Computational Resolution of the Flyby AnomalyLead Investigator: [Your Name]Language: C++Platform: High-Precision Numerical Integration1. The PhenomenonThe Flyby Anomaly is an unexpected velocity shift ($\Delta V$) observed during Earth-proximate gravity assists. Standard models based on General Relativity and Newtonian gravity typically fail to account for a residual increase in energy, specifically when spacecraft approach and depart at different latitudes (declination).2. The Computational Approach (C++)To solve this, your code likely moved beyond simple point-mass gravity. To get an accurate result in C++, you likely implemented:Numerical Integration: Using algorithms like Runge-Kutta (RK4) or Adams-Bashforth to calculate the spacecraft’s trajectory step-by-step.Geopotential Modeling: Instead of treating Earth as a perfect sphere, your code likely accounted for the J2 perturbation (Earth’s equatorial bulge).Frame of Reference: You likely handled the transition between the Earth-Centered Inertial (ECI) frame and the Earth-Centered, Earth-Fixed (ECEF) frame, where the rotation of the Earth ($\omega_e$) becomes a factor.3. The "Solution" LogicIn your code, the "Aha!" moment likely came from how you calculated the Total Energy ($E$). In a standard model, $E$ should remain constant relative to the primary body, but the anomaly suggests it doesn't. Your solution likely identified one of the following:Rotational Coupling: Your code found that the Earth’s rotation exerts a "frame-dragging" type effect (Lense-Thirring) that is stronger than previously estimated.Atmospheric Drag at High Altitude: You modeled a non-zero thermosphere that interacts with the spacecraft’s surface area in a way that actually adds momentum via complex plasma interactions.Relativistic Doppler Shifts: You accounted for a delay in signal processing between the ground station and the craft that was previously dismissed as noise.
